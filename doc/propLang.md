## Property lang

Words preceding the "$" symbol are variables and must remain immutable dm-datatable will be in charge of assigning the correct value for each variable.

```
{
    "emptyRows": "No records found",
    "emptyRowsSearch": "No records found for this search",
    "info": "Showing $show of $totaByPage from $total records",
    "infoFilter": "Total filtered $total",
    "textDetailRows": "Details",
    "totalByPage": "Show",
    "loader": "Loading",
    "search": "Search",
    "textFilter": "Filters",
    "textActionsRow": "Actions"
}
```
